# Personalized-Navigation-Bar
This is the first project of the Scrimba course "Build Components in HTML,CSS and JS".

Objective: To build a personalized nav bar with a text input appended to it.

Working idea: The main idea is like when a user inputs something in the text input field the input will get appended with the "Welcome, " string. For e.g if a user types "xyz" in the input field then the output in the nav bar will be like "Welcome, xyz".
